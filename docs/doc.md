This is the API reference for the LaunchDarkly SDK for browser JavaScript.

In typical usage, you will call {@link initialize} once at startup time to obtain an instance of
{@link LDClient}, which provides access to all of the SDK's functionality.

For more information, see the [SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/javascript).
